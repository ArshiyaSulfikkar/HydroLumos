### Project Description
Hydrolumos is a saltwater-powered light with a backup magnetic induction system. It offers reliable, eco-friendly lighting using saltwater electrolysis and manual energy generation, perfect for emergencies, remote locations, and sustainable living.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
During a flood with rising water, no power and a dead phone, there's a need for a reliable, effortless light source.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Hydrolumos provides a clean, battery-free lighting solution powered by saltwater, with a built-in magnetic induction backup system for manual power generation. It ensures dependable, eco-friendly light in any situation‚Äîideal for remote communities, disaster relief, and sustainable living.
